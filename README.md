<b>Description : </b> This is __Machine Learning__ based project where different __Ensembel Techniques__ are used to train our model. The whole project is created using __Scikit-learn Pipeline__. The whole pipeline is created by putting together a sequence of steps involved in training a machine learning model. Here an __End to End Scikit-learn Pipeline__ is created, begin from data preprocessing to model tunning, each and every thing is wrapped inside scikit learn pipeline and __executed as a single entity__. And at the end got a __test accuracy of 80%__.

<b>Dataset Source : </b>Available in repo.
